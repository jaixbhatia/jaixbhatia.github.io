I am an Assistant Professor in the Mathematics and Statistics department at San Diego State University. My research involves **issues of curriculum, pedagogy, and technology**, where I focus on ambitious and equitable instruction in mathematics, statistics, data science, and computer science classrooms. I have recently become interested in the role of **artificial intelligence** in education.

I earned my doctorate from Stanford University under the supervision of Hilda Borko. I received significant mentorship from Victor R. Lee, R. Benjamin Shapiro, Jennifer King Chen and Mykel Kochenderfer. Prior to my graduation, I worked as a research scientist at Apple Inc. and taught high school mathematics.
